# 100 Days Of Code - 2020 Log

### Day 0: July 29, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Forked this repository and created (additional) accountability plan for 100DaysOfCode - I'll be blogging about my progress at [blogtolearn.dev](blogtolearn.dev). Spent part of the day preparing for that process: briefly researching tech stacks, setting up dev environment on desktop (mac Mini running OS X Catalina) and laptop (Dell XPS 15 running Pop!\_OS 20.04), and playing around with the setup I'll be using to start blogging. I already had the blogtolearn.dev domain name, but changed the DNS records to prepare for deployment to the hosting provider tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: After doing some relatively quick research, I decided to create blogtolearn.dev using [11ty](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy), a Node-based, framework-agnostic static site generator which will allow me to create new blog posts simply by adding markdown files to a directory, hosted on Netlify. I chose 11ty (alt="eleventy") because I wanted to stay away from frameworks (for the time being), despite the relative abundance of popular options available, for the sake of simplicity. They also have a fantastic logo/mascot. [1] I still need to figure out what template language I'll be using, given the variety of choices they support, but that decision should be fairly insignificant for my simple use-case.

**Link(s) to work**: No work to link to yet, but here are some eleventy resources that I looked/worked through today:
- [Starter Projects from 11ty's Docs](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/starter/)
- [A basic 11ty blog tutorial](https://keepinguptodate.com/pages/2019/06/creating-blog-with-eleventy/#creating-the-homepage) that I went through.
